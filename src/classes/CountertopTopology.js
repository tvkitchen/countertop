 * CountertopToplogies are a complete set of valid *paths* that data might take across a given
 * array of CountertopStations.
 *
 * The distinction of paths (as opposed to edges / direct steps) is important, as a given payload
 * will have a source, and only payloads with a common source should be considered together in
 * the case of dual-input appliances.
 *
 * In many data processing pipelines, topologies need to be manually specified by the developer
 * configuring the system. In this case, the topologies are automatically generated based on which
 * appliances produce outputs that are valid inputs to others.
 *
 * The logic for generating a CountertopTopology starts in the static `generateStreams` method.
